# Bash Example for the usage of PWD encryption

With this very simple example we store the password of a script inside a simple password container..

The password file will be encrypted and decrypted with openssl.

For example to start SQL*Plus to extract data from the Oracle database ( see callSQLPlus.sh example)

This scripts are for education purpose to understand the general concept ( not 100% perfekt .-) ), fell free to optimize.

### Usage:

* Start first the script setPasswordFile.sh to set the password
* Use the simpleExample.sh to extract the password


This two files are simple as possible to show the basic idea behind this concept.

To call the sqlplus example, please set the environment inside the script.
